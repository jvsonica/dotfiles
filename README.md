# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles and configuration settings for various tools and applications I use.

This has been structured to be compatible with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html), so to apply these dotfiles, simply run:

```bash
# to stow a particular module
stow tmux

# to stow all modules
stow --adopt */
```

## Future Work

- nvim: fzf lua resume on leader+f+R
